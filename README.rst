Django ROTV apps

This package is a group of Django apps for running web tv website service.

Our story
---------

Originally this package was created for `Raport Obieżyświata <http://raportobiezyswiata.tv>`_ - a leading web tv channel
in Poland dedicated to sci-fi and fantasy news reporting, book reviews and conventions recaps.

Since the very begining the work of our group, we were working voluntarily to provide the best quality videos for
the Polish Fandom. Thus we decided to release our source code of the website on the OpenSource licenses to provide
others with tools for creating their own great project.

Installation
------------

See README.md for more details.
